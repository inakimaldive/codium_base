Great! If you're customizing the keybindings for **folding/unfolding code blocks** in **VSCodium**, you‚Äôll want something:

* **Intuitive**: easy to remember and grouped logically.
* **Ergonomic**: not awkward to press frequently.
* **Non-conflicting**: doesn‚Äôt override common actions like copy/paste, save, etc.

## üîß Suggested Keybindings

| Action                 | Suggested Shortcut    | Rationale                                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Collapse current block | `Alt` + `[`           | Simple, mnemonic (`[` looks like folding in)        |
| Expand current block   | `Alt` + `]`           | Opposite of collapse (`]` looks like unfolding out) |
| Collapse all blocks    | `Alt` + `Shift` + `[` | Adds `Shift` for ‚Äúall‚Äù/bulk action                  |
| Expand all blocks      | `Alt` + `Shift` + `]` | Consistent logic with others                        |

### ‚úÖ Why these are good:

* `Alt` + brackets (`[` and `]`) are **easy to reach** and generally **unused** in most programming contexts.
* Easy to remember:

  * `[` means in/fold, `]` means out/unfold
  * `Shift` means **do more** (apply to all)
* Won‚Äôt interfere with default shortcuts like:

  * `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+V` (copy/paste)
  * `Ctrl+Z`, `Ctrl+S`, etc.

---

### üîÑ How to Set These in VSCodium:

1. Open **Keyboard Shortcuts**:

   * `Ctrl + K` then `Ctrl + S`
2. Search for:

   * `Fold` (for collapse)
   * `Unfold` (for expand)
   * `Fold All`
   * `Unfold All`
3. Click the pencil icon next to each, then press your new key combo.
4. Press **Enter** to confirm.

Let me know if you‚Äôd prefer a different modifier (like `Ctrl` or `Cmd`) or want Mac-specific alternatives!
